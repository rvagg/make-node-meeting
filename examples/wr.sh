## Public participation

We stream our conference call straight to YouTube. Anyone can listen to it live. When we turn it on, it should start playing at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ/live. There's a short cat-herding time at the beginning of the meeting and, occasionally, we attend to some quick private business before we can start recording & streaming. Please be patient and the live stream should show up!

Welcome to the Website Redesign Initiative! ðŸ’›
